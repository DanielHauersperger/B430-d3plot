# d3plot

- This is our groups final project for PBHL-B430 Advanced Computing
- The package gives the ability for users to make D3 plots
- There is a basic Shiny Gadget that lets users explore their data using the D3 plots
- A basic implementation of OOP is built in for project requirements

## Example

Loading `d3plot`:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(d3plot)
```

### Scatter Plots

```{r, eval=FALSE}
d3_scatter(mtcars, mph, hp)
```
